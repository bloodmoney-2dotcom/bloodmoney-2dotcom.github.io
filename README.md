## üïπÔ∏èBloodMoney2 Game Description

BloodMoney2 is a narrative-driven psychological horror simulation game released in 2025. The player takes on the role of Eun-Mi Harvington, who uploads her husband Harvey's consciousness into a simulation system. Every night, Harvey may be tortured in exchange for money, and every morning his memory is erased and only the player remembers everything. This cycle raises some profound questions: If pain is forgotten, does it still matter? Is morality linked to memory, or to the act itself? How will players act when the consequences are erased? The game features multiple branching endings, shaped by the player's choices, with a minimalist and oppressive atmosphere, and psychological horror built on responsibility rather than scary. In addition, the game, although a standalone narrative, also expands the BloodMoney universe.
